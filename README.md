# Containerization

A home for my container learning, quick revisions, and production-style app containers.

- **`docker/`** → quick revision playground: tiny examples, beginner images, notes.
- **`apps/` (planned)** → real applications, each with its own Dockerfile and docs.
- **`compose/` (planned)** → Docker Compose stacks for local multi-service setups.
- **`k8s/` (planned)** → Kubernetes manifests / Helm charts.

> Keep experiments in `docker/`, and put real services in `apps/`. This separation keeps the repo tidy and avoids mixing throwaway examples with production-like code.
